icptests version 1.0


This distribution contains code and data to accompany:

	"A Symmetric Objective Function for ICP"
	ACM Transactions on Graphics (Proc. SIGGRAPH) 38(4), July 2019.


All of the programs require trimesh2, version 2.15 or later, which may be
downloaded from trimesh2.cs.princeton.edu - please contact smr@princeton.edu
if you cannot get the programs to compile.


The following programs are included:


icpconvergence
--------------

Computes data for plots of per-iteration convergence (Figure 4 in the paper),
for a variety of ICP variants.

Usage: icpconvergence in1.ply in2.ply [variant] [ntrials]

The following values for "variant" are accepted:

0: Point-to-point
1: Point-to-plane
2: Symmetric
3: Two-plane
4: Symmetric-RN
5: Quadratic

For final results, an ntrials value of 1000 is suggested.


compute_icpconvergence.sh
-------------------------

This is a shell script to run icpconvergence on all pairs of meshes listed
in data/convergence_tests.txt

It will place its results in convergence_results/*.txt

If gnuplot is installed, it will additionally produce plots of the results
in convergence_results/*.pdf

Note that the plots for aligning bun000 and bun090 will be slightly different
from those in the paper (though qualitatively the same), because of small
differences in the bun000.ply and bun090.ply that are included in this
distribution.

For generating final results, it is suggested that the script be edited to set
ntrials=1000


icprobustness
-------------

Computes data testing ICP robustness under perturbations to initial
translation/rotation (Figure 5 in the paper).

Usage: icprobustness in1.ply in2.ply [variant] [ntrials]


The same values for "variant" as above are accepted, plus:

6: Levenberg-Marquardt Point-to-plane
7: Levenberg-Marquardt Symmetric

For final results, an ntrials value of 1000 is suggested.


compute_icprobustness.sh
------------------------

This is a shell script to run icprobustness on all pairs of meshes listed
in data/robustness_tests.txt

It will place its results in robustness_results/*.txt, then execute
results2svg to make SVG charts.

If inkscape is installed, it will additionally convert the SVG charts to PDF,
placing the results in robustness_results/*.pdf

For generating final results, it is suggested that the script be edited to set
ntrials=1000
